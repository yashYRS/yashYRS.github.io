The plan is to make a storytelling game, which tests the calibre of the child and his leaning towards a certain aspect of intelligence. The overall aim in the game would be to find where the treasure is, and in a bid to do that the player has to go through a series of adventures, with each adventure checking/testing one of the intelligence aspects as discussed by Gardner in his theory of Multiple Intelligence. The main challenge, in designing such a game is to hold the attention of the child, since a question answer based game becomes too boring for kids, no matter how much the parents advocates playing them, ergo the main motivation behind making the game in such a format is to make sure that the children never realize that they are being tested in any way whatsover. A score for all the 8 intelligence aspects isn't produced for the children to see, since upon seeing a low score in any particular format, kids could get heavily discouraged and actually start believing that they aren't good enough in that particular aspect. Instead, the proposal is to only show in the application the intelligence subtype in which the kid's performance was the best, with encouraging taglines. There will be options to get the detailed analysis of the report as well for the parent (through email, not to be viewed in the game console). The detailed report would not factor just 1 session of the game, instead each session is judged and the report keeps getting updated. For multiple kids playing through the same device, there will be options to add player names, thus avoiding conflicts in the report.

Example of some of the adventures - Note : If the performance in a particular aspect is good, more adventures covering that aspect pop up, also the difficulty levels keep increasing.

Word Smart : There will be sample conversations between 2 people that are displayed, with certain clues to reach the final destination being hidden in the conversation. Thus if the child actually figures that out and uses the hint to move forward, points are awarded.

Math Smart : A Time limit within which a lock has to be opened by solving some logic based puzzles (if solved in less time more points). Other activities include fitting different shapes(objects) in a square(shown as a suitcase), more the number of items, more the points awarded.

Body Smart : Gravity based movement, along the lines of Subway Surfer, avoid obstacles along the journey, hand eye coordination of the kid gets tested in this manner. Scoring done with respect to the number of obstacles avoided, the time for which there was no collision.

Picture Smart : Pictorially rich Maps to get to the destination given at the start of the game, if the shortest path is being taken according to the map, points awarded, further getting out of Mazes in certain parts of the game, solving jigsaw puzzles to open locks.

Music Smart : There are pits placed along the path, on falling in them, the player dies, upon which the player can restart from the point where he/she had left upon completing some activity, eg: a GIF shown, the player has to choose amongst given options an appropriate background score. Other activities would include choosing amongst junctures where different sounds indicate what could be expected along a path, eg : sound of a tiger/ birds/ elephants coming from 3 different paths. If the safest path chosen, points are awarded.

People Smart : There will be a lot of people that a player encounters along the game, a conversation can be initiated with each of them, and each can contribute in some way or the other. If the player interacts and makes them allies, points are awarded in this domain.

Nature Smart : There will be chocolate bars available along the journey. On eating them, there will be options to throw the wrapper. There will always be a dustbin around if a bar/any other food item is provided. If the player makes a effort to go to the dustbin to throw the wrapper, points are awarded. Again, there will be activities where there is a time limit (a gateway closing), but some natural resources are being wasted (eg: tap running), the player has to sacrifice time, to stop the wastage (close the tap water).

Self Smart : The player would come across some people who would come up to player and have a story to share. Upon hearing the story, there will be options to hear more/ignore the story and move on. If the player pays heed to the story, shows some empathy, provides some suggestions to the people who came up to him ,points are awarded.

An important thing to note here is the fact that the adventures here are completely seperate from each other, so the order in which they appear apart from a few cases, would not matter. Thus our AI agent, would figure out where the child's leaning is, and based on that not show some adventures at all, or show more of a particular kind of adventure.

To develop the game, we would be using various modules available in Python (eg: pyglet, cocos2d ) and MongoDB (for back end) to make a PC based application with limited graphic support due to lack of domain expertise in game development and design.

Future Extensions possible :

The game could be made available on a lot of other platforms, so an android version of the app/ web based version could be developed.
The number of adventures in each of the subdomains could be added, with adventures being tagged more appropriately for age groups.
