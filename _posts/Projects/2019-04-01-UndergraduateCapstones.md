### DBS Project

A simplistic database application wherein students of a college can search for Alumni of their college and get their contact details, for references, gaining knowledge about their respective fields or ask any doubts in general about how the industry actually functions, done as a part of the 4th Semester Database Systems Lab Capstone Project.

### Compiler Design

This project was created as a part of the Compiler Design Lab in the 6th Semester of my Undergraduate course at Manipal Institute of Technology. This rudimentary compiler for java programs was implemented using bison and flex. It has basic error recovery strategy implemented as well, thus missing semicolons in for statements are detected and missing paranthesis are taken care of.

### PCAP Project

This is a parallel CUDA implementation in C of the algorithm proposed in the research paper by Woodhall et al. Woodhall, M. C., and C. S. Lindquist. "New edge detection algorithms based on adaptive estimation filters." Conference Record of the Thirty-First Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (Cat. No. 97CB36136). Vol. 2. IEEE, 1997.
