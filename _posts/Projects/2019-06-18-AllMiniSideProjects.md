Like any other beginner to the field, I have experimented with different technologies, often times collaborating with others to learn more about a particular topic that spurred interest. That over time, has led to me making weird, unsurprisingly unsustainable projects in short bursts. However each of these projects acted as a gateway for me into a new domain, and therefore are memorable for me. 

### Alpha Beta Pruning to make a game engine

The perception that I had about AI when I was in high school was almost entirely built up by the hype around how no chess grandmaster was capable of beating a chess engine (that and JARVIS in Ironman xD ). It was inevitable that the first thing I started reading about, after learning the fundamentals of programming was how to make a chess engine. Today, I appreciate the intricacies of AI and my understanding of the field has evolved since, but when I read about alpha-beta pruning, the elegance of it all to make game engines suitable for almost any kind of game with perfect information had removed a lot of the mystique behind something I was utterly fascinated by at that point. The game that I chose to make was Tic-Tac-Toe, since I did not want to spend time, on coding up the graphics of chess, but was just interested in making alpha-beta pruning work. It took me a weekend's time to make this game, but till date, whenever I am bored, I just fire up the game and start playing.

### Sudoku Solver

Combined neural network and image processing, to learn something about this 

### Imetay

Angular web dev, asynchrous programming, the thing you used for graphs

### Earthquake Detection System

Just a seemingly novel idea, computer vision, using azure, django.
