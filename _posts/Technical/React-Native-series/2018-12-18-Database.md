_Note : Haven't put up any introductory post on setting up React Native Environment, since there are a lot of 
references available for that already. Also I recommend going through the following repository, it has an all
expansive list of react-native study material : [Repo link](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native)_

A local database is almost a bare-minimum for the making of even the simplest of apps, and like any other technologies, 
there's a lot to choose from in terms of what one might want to use in their application, to accomplish local storage. 
[This](https://aboutreact.com/local-database-in-react-native-app/) offers a great overall outlook for the options available out there to implement local database in React-Native apps.

### Sqlite : 
It uses a third party module called : 'react-native-sqlite-storage', thus same needs to be added by yarn. Therefore setting 
up the project involves -> 
	
	react-native init ProjectName 
	cd ProjectName
	yarn add react-native-sqlite-storage 
	yarn add react-navigation 

Now, this isn't enough, since we need to provide some extra information in the android-specific folder, for these databases to work properly.

Step 1 : Add to the dependencies section in android/app/build.gradle

	implementation project(':react-native-sqlite-storage')

Step 2 : Add to the android/settings.gradle

	include ':react-native-sqlite-storage'
	project(':react-native-sqlite-storage').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-sqlite-storage/src/android'

Step 3 : Add to MainApplication.java 
	import org.pgsqlite.SQLitePluginPackage // import statement 

	new SQLitePluginPackage() // append to getPackages

After following the above steps, the application is now ready to use sqlite-database. The basic syntax of an sqlite execute function is as follows 
		
	db.transaction(function(txn) {
  		txn.executeSql(
		    query,                 //Query same as in Sqlite
    		argsToBePassed[],      //Argument to the query 
    		function(tx, res) {}   //ToDo with the result
  		);
	});

However before it is used, importing **openDatabase** is necessary, and opening the database is necessary as well. 
Here though the database being accessed does not necessarily have to be created before hand, if nothing is present,
a new albeit empty database is created. We can even manipulate existing databases and is precisely the reason why we 
would even consider using SQLite plugins, since although it is used across domains in myriad applications, the plugin provided
in React Native is slower compared to other alternative, for eg : Realm.

	import {openDatabase} from 'react-native-sqlite-storage'
	var db = openDatabase({name : 'name-of-database.db'})



Thus for illustration a sample operation of all the operations are being shown below : 

#### Query a table 
	db.transaction(tx => {
	      		tx.executeSql(
	        		'SELECT * FROM table_user where user_id = ?', [this.search_user_id],
	        		(tx, results) => {
	        			// DO SOMETHING WITH THE RESULTS, DISPLAY OR SET VALUES 
	        		}
	        	)
			}
		);

#### Insert into a table 
	db.transaction(tx => {
	      		tx.executeSql(
	        		'INSERT INTO table_user (user_name, user_id) VALUES (?,?)', [this.state.name,this.state.id],
	        		(tx, results) => {
	        			// After execution of the insert statement, this function gets executed 
	        		}
	        	)
			}
		);

#### Create a table 
	db.transaction(tx => {
	      		tx.executeSql( 
	      			'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_user(user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, user_name VARCHAR(20)' 
	      		)
			}
		);

#### Update values in a table 
	db.transaction(tx => {
	      		tx.executeSql(
	        		'UPDATE table_user set user_id = ?. user_name = ?', [this.state.id, this.state.name],
	        		(tx, results) => {
	        			// After execution of the update statement, this function gets executed 
	        		}
	        	)
			}
		);


#### Delete 
	db.transaction(tx => {
	      		tx.executeSql(
	        		'DELETE FROM table_user where user_id = ?', [this.search_user_id],
	        		(tx, results) => {
	        			// After delete, this function gets executed 
	        		}
	        	)
			}
		);

A very common error is to not handle the data types appropriately while trying to do any CRUD operation on the database, 
especially if the state variables are being used to change/update/insert values in the database. For eg: use parseInt(str,10) 
if the required type is Integer for a particular column in database. 
The reference code for this post can be found [here](https://github.com/yashYRS/Learning_ReactNative/tree/master/SqliteDemo) and a good reference for an IOS-app demo for SQLite is available in this blog [post](https://brucelefebvre.com/blog/2018/11/06/react-native-offline-first-db-with-sqlite/). Hope this helped!!
