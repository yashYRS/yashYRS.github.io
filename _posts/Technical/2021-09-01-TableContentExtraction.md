Table extraction fall under the umbrella of Document Intelligence, a relatively new research topic that deals with analzying and understanding business documents. The documents vary in style, layouts, fonts and generally have a complex template. Since digitisation of documents is a recent phenonmenon, majority of such documents are scanned copies of their printed counterparts. The poor quality of images, skew arising due to scans made in haste compound the difficulty of the problem. Especially in the financial domain, where the significance of every number and alphabet is paramount. Manual supervision along with some software aid is the current norm, however each day, efforts are made to reduce the amount of interventions required by humans. Extracting tables from these documents is one such sub domain, which has attracted a lot of researchers. Tables do not have a specified way of being constructed, and often the artistic proclivities involved in making tables look more presentable, add a layer to the difficulty of the problem. Most of the information in tables would make sense, if the relationships and contexts are known prior, as tables generally contain limited data.
