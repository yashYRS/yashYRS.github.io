I am pursuing my M.Sc. in Language Science and Technology at Universit√§t des Saarlandes. I also work at [LaCoCo](https://lacoco-lab.github.io/home/), headed by Dr. Michael Hahn, as a Research Assistant.

My interests lie in enhancing the interpretability, reliability, and correctness of language models. I believe that incorporating linguistic knowledge into these models and controlling domains can effectively reduce training scale and model parameter size without compromising performance.

I am also fascinated by the evolution and acquisition of language in humans and actively follow research advancements in this field.

Prior to joining my Masters, and after completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2020, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for three years in the R&D team at Glib.ai. Additionally, I have held internships in the On-Device AI division at Samsung R&D Bangalore and at Novartis, Hyderabad India.
