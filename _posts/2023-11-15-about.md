I am pursuing my M.Sc. in Language Science and Technology at Universit√§t des Saarlandes. The Masters program covers diverse topics from computational linguistics, phonetics, speech science to Psycholinguistics, Language Evolution & Acquisition. I also work as a Research Assistant under Dr. Michael Hahn at his lab [LaCoCo](https://lacoco-lab.github.io/home/), where we work on enhancing the interpretability and correctness of language models.

My research interest lies in coming up with ways to effectively reduce training scale and model parameter size without compromising performance in Language Models. I believe that injecting linguistic knowledge into LLMs in a Hybrid model structure while controlling for the allowed domains is one of the potentially many ways to do that.

I am equally fascinated by the evolution and acquisition of language in humans and actively follow the latest discourse on the same.

Prior to joining my Masters, and after completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2020, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for three years in the R&D team at Glib.ai. Additionally, I have held internships in the On-Device AI division at Samsung R&D Bangalore and at Novartis, Hyderabad India.
