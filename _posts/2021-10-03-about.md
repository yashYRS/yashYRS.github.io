I am a graduate from Manipal Institute of Technology with a major in Computer Science. I work in the R&D team at Glib, where we develop document processing softwares that convert business documents into analyzable information within seconds enabling real-time decision making for our clients.

Prior to this, I was an intern at Samsung R&D Bangalore, where I worked in the On-Device AI division on projects that aimed at improving user's interaction with screenshots. My role dabbled from training models for script identification, to data augmentation for text localization in screenshots.


Although I am fascinated with deep learning models and try to keep myself updated with the latest developments on it, my primary interest lies in research that approaches NLP problems from a linguistic standpoint. I wish to pursue my masters and hopefully a PhD as well in future, and contribute to the research community in a meaningful way. 

I strive to keep the posts non-redundant, although in the process end up writing sparingly. The structure of the blog is as follows

* **Projects:** Posts explaining some of my projects
* **Thoughts:** Some random thoughts and a few personal stories
* **Technical:** Posts from the world of Computer Science, that I hope would be useful to the people reading

Looking forward to suggestions, criticisms and possible collaborations.
