I am Computer Science Graduate from Manipal Institute of Technology, currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Glib](https://glib.ai/). I am part of the R&D team, and our primary focus is to bring out a semblance of structure to the myriad unstructured formats in which financial documents are generated.

Prior to this, I was an intern at Samsung R&D Bangalore, where I worked in the On-Device AI division on projects that aimed at improving user's interaction with screenshots. My role dabbled from training models for script identification, to data augmentation for text localization in screenshots.

I have long been inclined towards exploring Natural Language Processing, although I am equally fascinated with anything related to AI in general. I wish to pursue my masters and hopefully a PhD as well in future, and contribute to the research community in a meaningful way. 

Looking forward to suggestions, criticisms and possible collaborations.
