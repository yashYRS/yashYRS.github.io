How the participation idea was just so that as roommates, we could spend more time. 

The format and the brainstorming process

The news of selection and the hustle that followed 

The journey to the place 

Start -> promising on course, 1st few rounds of review was positive 

The hysteria just after the second touch morning -> Losing some calm 

The coming back from the dead + presentation  

The announcement, and the story between the announcement & asking us about the speech
