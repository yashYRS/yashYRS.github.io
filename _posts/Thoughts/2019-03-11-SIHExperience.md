#### How we ended up participating

On some night in January 2019, me and my roommates Aadil & Sushant were discussing how the hectic schedule in our college, and all our other commitments for improving our profiles left virtually meant that we weren't spending time with each other at all. We all agreed that the only way to actually hang out more, was if we all were working on the same project. We started looking out for options, and after carefully weighing in our alternatives, we decided on participating in the Smart India Hackathon. The decision was guided by the kind of projects on offer, and a time frame that would have allowed to us to maintain our other commitments, manage classes and assignments and still give about 20 hours per week to this project. A blatant flaw with this plan that we realized much later was that this competition was one which a lot of people from all across the country looked forward to, with some even spending more than a year preparing for it. For us, the first round of the competition was about 20 days away, with the final round in about 2 months time. There was another catch, each team had to have a minimum of 6 members, and after a mix of deliberation & persuation over the next week, we managed to form a team, adding Daniel, Arshia and Damodar to our team, all of whom were our batchmates.  


#### The 1st round

The competition portal had released the problem statements somewhere around July 2018, and the format of the competition was that each such problem statement had a solitary winners prize. Each category's winner would be selected out of the 4 teams, that would be selected after the 1st round. However, in case a problem statement did not have impressive enough submissions, that problem statement would be scrapped. Although each team was allowed to submit proposals to 3 unique problem statements. The challenge for us, was to select a problem think about a solution for that, and also assess the probability that the problem in question was picked up by others as well. The initial discussions between our team did not not bear any fruit owing to a sense of disharmony between our team members. Some of the members were meeting with each other for the first time, and were not happy with the inequity in the work that was being done. At that time, we had to make a decision we had been putting up till now - selecting a team captain. Again, since the team captain would have to take care of a lot of the administrative side of things without getting any extra credit in the end result, nobody volunteered to take the part. Eventually I agreed to take up the role after a blind vote, where we chose the people we wanted to see become the captain. I distinctly remember the first discussion that we had post that vote. We all were standing in a circle outside our food court, faces looking grim in the team. We all pledged to dedicate a substantial amount of our time to this project, agreeing that taking it lightly and just continuing to act on a whim and taking it lightly would lead to nothing but a waste of time. Over the next week we all warmed up to each other, working till late at night on somedays to brainstorm over ideas. We eventually narrowed down 2 problems, and submitted proposals for them, the 1st problem statement was to build an application to find a nearby parking spot and the 2nd one was to build a game based on Gardner's theory of Intelligence to gauge the aptitude of a child, and recommend possible career options he/she might be suited for. We submitted the results on the final day, but most of us had a feeling that our solution for parking spot finder was the one that had a chance of being picked up if at all.  


#### A surprise and some second thoughts

After having made the submission, the next few days were quite as our sessional exams had started. Once our exams got over, we went about inquiring about in all the departments of our college about the other teams that had participated from our college. We found out, that 4 more teams had participated just like us, and we also found out that our college campus was one of the places where the final round was going to be held. After another week, we eventually did get the results of the 1st round. We were the only team that actually did make it through from our college in the 2nd round, but to our surprise, we actually were selected for the problem statement that we were less confident in. But to our dismay the center for participation for the 2nd round for our problem statement specifically was in Jaipur, which was about 2000 Km away from our college campus in Manipal. Since the 2nd round was only a fortnight away, we seriously thought of quitting the event, since booking air tickets at such a late juncture would have cost us more than our combined prize money. The other option was to travel via train, which would involve 5 days of travel time to and from, with a 2 day stay in the Jaipur center for the competition. The issue here was that our college did not ususally provide any kind of support for students travelling to other venues for participation, which implied that the labs and assignmemnts we would miss during that period wouldn't be rescheduled for us, our grades would get heavily affected. And in all of this, we were not even thinking about the extra time and effort that would be required to get a prototype for our proposal ready by the day of the final competition. We again had a long meeting amongst ourselves, and eventually agreed that such an experience of being in the final four of a national level competition should not be missed upon. We charted out the plans, set up timelines, completed a lot of the administrative work which included creating tshirts for every member in the team, getting permissions from multiple departments in the college, getting printed banners and standees all of which was mandatory. The only bit of support we got in the entire process was from the guy we went to for making the standees, who promised not charging us, if we won the competition. We also had to select a team name. Having seen Mr. Robot recently and in a bid to get over the formalities, we named ourselves PySociety. By this time, the team had really bonded and spirits were generally high, when we were working together. So, the actual goal of getting to hang out more with friends was somewhere being accomplished, before us realizing it. 


#### The journey

About 60 % of the work had been completed, when we were about to board the train from Manipal. It was a long journey in front of us, the first train would take us to Mumbai, where we would have to wait for about 9 hours, before boarding the train for Jaipur. We however, had kept local copies of documentations, had taken enough power backup to be able to work without internet during the train journey. We arrived at Mumbai, the Chattrapati Sivaji terminal station somewhere around 3 in the night. Aadil in our team hailed from Navi Mumbai, so after the mandatory walk along Marine Drive when the sea front just looks majestic, we headed towards his home. Aadil's Mom had made biriyani for us and to this day, I haven't had biriyani that has tasted as good. We left for Jaipur where all of us were in jovial mood throughout the long train journey. At the time of our arrival at the Jaipur center around 4 PM on the 1st March, 75% of the work was completed. We were satisfied with the progress, but we knew that we wouldn't be able to get any work on that day, since there was an impending opening ceremony in the evening, and the competition was due to start at 6 in the morning the next day. We eventually kept everything low key and slept early. 5 of us guys were given one apartment by the organizers, and all the girls from the all the teams were staying in another block. The block in which our apartment was given was under maintenance and was isolated from the rest of the campus, giving the entire place an eerie feeling. In our apartment though, there were only 2 beds which could take no more than 3 people. We were given 2 extra mattresses which we kept in the living room. Me and Sushant were sleeping there peacefully and around 5 in the morning we heard vehement knocking on the door. Altough none of us had faith in the existence of spectral beings, the sudden outburst in such an isolated environment terrified us, and we literally started screaming in fear. Everybody in the apartment woke up, we opened the door and we saw no one. We stood outside, confused about the entire ordeal, and just then someone in the corridor shouted that it was just a local guard who liked to play such pranks. 


After that uncanny start, we got ready and made our way to the hall. There were to be 3 rounds of presentations over the course of the next 36 hours. There was little chance to fraternize with other teams since a considerable amount of work was still left. We got down to it and started working. About 14 hours in, we had our 1st round of presentation in front of the judging panel who gave us their feedback. We estimated that the with the progress that we had made, incorporating the feedback along with completing the rest of the project would take us around 10 hours more, and we would have time to spare before the final presentation. The competition rules mandated the presence of at least 2 members at the table assigned to us. We made
