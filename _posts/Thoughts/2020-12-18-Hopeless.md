Start with the first few months at Samsung, renting your house, getting a decent salary, whims with the lifestyle that followed. 

News about Admission, life during lockdown, decision to stay. 

Came back, with the last communication open ended. 

Joined a local internship, which was a living nightmare. 

TMJ and the problems that ensued.

The IIT KgP interview, 
selection into BEL, promise of joining in last week of november, 
then no communication from them. 

Joining into Crossover, first day of work. Light going, test rescheduled, missed by a whisker. 

Next few days, tongue surgery, so could not speak, or give interviews. 

16th night started speaking again applied at a place that looked decent. 

17th interview, terms etc.., 18th started working, happens to be my birthday
