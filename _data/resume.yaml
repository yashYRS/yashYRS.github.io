        - **Winners Smart India Hackathon 2019**: A 36 hour non-stop code sprint, organized
          by the Government of India with over 3 lakh participants. I was the leader of 6 member
          team that won the competition, wherein the project we worked upon comprised of a set of
          games that would test various aspects of a childâ€™s intelligence, based on Gardners Theory of
          Multiple Intelligence. An AI bot would track the progress of the child playing the game, and
          try to ascertain the leaning of the child towards a particular module of intelligence
        - **GE HackElt, Pan India Finalists 2019**: A national level hackathon organized by General
          Electric India. I was a part of a 3 member team that made it to the top 10. The project made
          for the same was a Hospital Appointment Management System, that would predict the time a patient
          would have to wait before getting a consult from a doctor of their choice. Along with it, analytics
          would be generated for the doctors themselves, highlighting the various fallacies in the overall time
          management in the hospital.

    title: Selected Projects & Contributions
    text: |
        - [**SAdam An Adam Variant**](https://github.com/naruarjun/SADAM-reproducibility): Carried 
        out a Reproducibility study on the paper SAdam: A Variant of Adam for Strongly Convex
        Functions and implemented the same in Pytorch.
        - [**Earthquake Detection System**](https://github.com/yashYRS/DetectEarthquake): A prototype to detect
        earthquakes based on the fact that most objects in a live feed would vacillate about their positions
        during earthquakes. The bounding boxes of static objects were kept track of, and in case their positions
        would deviate to cross a threshold on a prefixed proportion of cameras belonging to the same area, a
        ping for emergency would be sent out to authorities in charge.
        - [**Parallelizing Mean Filter based Edge Detection**](https://github.com/tanmay2298/Parallel-Implementation-of-Edge-Detection-Algorithms): The
        Adaptive edge detection process done using Weiner filter was parallelized and implemented
        for both the CUDA and the Message Passing Interface frameworks using C
        - [**Facial Recognition System on a Raspberry Pi**](): A biometric attendance system with an IR sensor
        for spoof detection. A webserver to view the status of the attendance and an MQTT interface to perform
        remote transactions on the database were also developed.
