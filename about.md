I am currently a 3rd year student pursuing an under graduate course in Computer Science Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology. I am inclined towards research in fields pertaining to Artificial Intelligence, although I am equally fascinated with anything related to Computers. Have done some projects and internships in a bid to further my knowledge.
